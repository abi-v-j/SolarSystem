## About the Setup

This project uses the following tools and plugins for an efficient development workflow:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A popular library for 3D rendering and animations in the browser.
- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction): A React renderer for Three.js, making 3D rendering declarative.

## Features

- **Interactive Solar System:** Explore planets and their orbits in a visually engaging way.
- **Real-Time Animations:** Smooth animations powered by Three.js.
- **Fast Development:** Vite ensures hot module replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience.
